<summary>TW!! why i think its bad (if you care...)</summary>

i do not necessarily think it is completely horrible, i do not care if you proship/darkship, but please just **do it behind closed doors**. making it your entire personality online and plastering it all over your social media essentially makes it not a coping mechanism, but a hobby. coping should not be plastered all over social media if it is done for a real trauma response. i am against people encouraging their harmful coping mechanisms over social media (like for ex. self harm, stuff like shtwt, age **play** (NOT to be confused with age **regressing,** which is genuinely not harmful!) and romanticizing it. children are all over social media these days, and stumbling upon something they should not see is a very big possibility. the most responsible thing you can do is make sure you do not contribute to the problem of immoral ships/concepts being put all over social media, and keep it private. i am completely pro-recovery and i wish dark/proshippers all the best, despite our differences in opinion. everyone should have a space where they are free to talk about their experiences with people who understand, however encouraging it, sharing it everywhere is not what i support. thanks for reading!

PS!!! if you saw me with a yandere simulator skin - **I DO NOT SUPPORT YANDERE DEV!!!!** i am strongly against him and believe he should be arrested for what he has done. i simply like the design of certain characters
